# FocusNode

The root class here uses a class I found in Apple's documentation for ARKit apps that I wanted to have easy to use myself, and thought others would benefit from it too.

[Medium Article about this CocoaPod](https://medium.com/@maxxfrazer/arkit-pods-focusnode-46343cffe7fe)


It was found inside the downloadable project on the following page:
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/handling_3d_interaction_and_ui_controls_in_augmented_reality

I've added the license from that project to this repository.

Include this pod in your Podfile like so:

```
pod 'FocusNode'
```

Then import `FocusNode` to your .swift file and add it to your scene as so:

```
let focusNode = FocusSquare()
sceneView.scene.rootNode.addChildNode(self.focusNode)
focusNode.viewDelegate = sceneView
```

Check out the Example project or message me on GitHub or twitter if it's unclear.


The Example project looks like this:

I DID NOT WRITE A MAJORITY OF THIS CODE MYSELF, MOST OF IT WAS TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM APPLE'S EXAMPLES
